A collection of cross-platform MIDI processing plugins written in C++. Current downloads are (mostly) for Windows only, but eventually some nice person will compile them for OSX and Linux.

---

This project is in two main parts:

# pizmidi #
Small, useful MIDI processing VST plugins. They use the host-provided GUI for maximum smallness and easy development. These use the plain VST 2.4 SDK.

# pizjuce #
Things that are more complicated or that otherwise require a GUI use [JUCE](http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/).
